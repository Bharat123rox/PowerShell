will need to fill this directory out with code demos / samples to get people working

I'm adding a "demos" directory, where we can add sample scripts that do certain functions. since these would be held in the main repo, we should model them around common user stories, like the following:

create a VM
update a VM
Create a multi-tier application
create a microseg rule
etc

Additionally, we should see if we can integrate these heavily with Pester, such that our demos are always validated with CICD
